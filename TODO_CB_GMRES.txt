TODO CB-GMRES for Paper review

1. change stopping criterion: 1e-12
2. Use Cusparse ILU preconditioner
3. Always run GmresMixed<float, float> in addition to the other benchmarks
4. Run both Classical and Modified Grahm-Schmidt and compare them
   (Add regular Ginkgo Gmres<double> to the benchmark and compare MGS with CGS)
5. Run everything with Restart = 300
6. Remove matrices from same group (e.g. af_*) from the plots
7. Run MGS vs CGS without preconditioner
